## 🚀 Overview

**Sanjeevani** is an end-to-end AI system that predicts forest fire risks and simulates their spread across time, enabling real-time geospatial decision-making for forest departments, disaster response teams, and government agencies.

> Developed for ISRO Hackathon 2025, the project uses advanced deep learning, satellite data, and cloud-native GIS tools to predict fire probabilities and simulate 1–12 hour fire progression.
